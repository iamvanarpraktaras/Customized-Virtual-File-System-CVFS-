1) In This Project I Emulate All Data Structures Which Are Used By Operating System To Manage File System Oriented Tasks.
2) As The Name Suggests Its Virtual Because I Maintain All The Records In Primary Storage (RAM).
# About Customized Virtual File System
3) In This Project I Create All Data Structures Which Required For File Subsystems As : FT, UAREA, UFDT, SB, DILB, DB etc.
```1) In This Project I Emulate All Data Structures Which Are Used By Operating System To Manage File System Oriented Tasks.```
4) I Provide All Implementations Of Necessary System Calls And Commands Of File subsystem As : Open, Close, Read, Write, Lseek, Create, RM, LS, Stat, Fstat etc.
```2) As The Name Suggests Its Virtual Because I Maintain All The Records In Primary Storage (RAM).```
5) While Creating This Project All Above Functionality I Use Our Own Data Structures By Referring Algorithms of UNIX Operating System.
6) By Using This Project I Can Get Overview Of UFS (UNIX File System) On Any Platform.
